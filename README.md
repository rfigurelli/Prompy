## Executive Summary

Prompy proposes a minimalist, declarative language designed to turn compact task descriptions into complete Python scripts using large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional code generators or domain-specific languages (DSLs), Prompy reduces the user’s input to a short, structured YAML-like file that can be directly interpreted by prompt-based systems to yield working, self-documenting code. This architecture enables seamless automation and empowers both developers and non-programmers to generate functional software with near-zero boilerplate.

To illustrate the simplicity and power of Prompy, consider a minimal example: the canonical "Hello, World!" script. Using Prompy, this script can be defined with just two lines:

```prompy
agent: Hello World
task: Print 'Hello, World!' to the console
```

This `.prompy` file generates the following natural language prompt:

```
Create a Python script named "Hello World" that prints 'Hello, World!' to the console.
```

And from that, a complete and executable Python file:

```python
"""
Hello World Script

Author: Generated by Prompy
Date: May 8, 2025
"""

print('Hello, World!')
```

This demonstrates how even the most basic scripts can be defined declaratively and generated reliably, establishing a baseline for more complex use cases.

The rise of generative AI and large language models has made it possible to create software through natural language. However, existing tools often demand verbose inputs, proprietary syntax, or code scaffolding. Prompy aims to solve this by introducing an archetype: a structured micro-language for expressing intent with the fewest possible words, and converting it to code through prompt-based generation.
